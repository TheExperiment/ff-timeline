      <p>
      Not sure when exactly it started, but at some point in the last fifteen years, while making things for the web, I convinced myself that the insane hours I was working were for my wife and kids. You know, for our collective “future.” I was sure if I just devoted extra time to learning, making, reading and collaborating with the right smart people, eventually I’d reach a level of productivity and prestige which would afford me the time and money needed to live the life I dreamed of living with my family. What’s obvious now, wasn’t. Research from a 75 year study on the happiness of Harvard graduates shows how wrong I was. I didn’t go to college but I’m comfortable assuming that what the study found, applies to me anyway. It concluded that above all else quality relationships are what make us happy and healthy <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness" target="_blank">(video)</a>. More than anything, happiness and health are what I want for my son. I hope them for you and <span class="his-name">your son</span> as well.
      </p>

      We floated the idea of making Future Father back in October of 2014. Around 500 people signed up. The idea was spurred by a problem I have with my dad. It’s the same problem he has with his dad. The problem is, we don’t go out of our way to make time for each other. We don’t have any plans to one day have adventures. We get along great! I love him and he loves me but we aren’t making the most of the short time we have left together. And it’s getting shorter every day. This is not a problem I’m willing to have with my son. I am working on Future Father for selfish reasons. I am trying to solve personal problems. But I know they aren’t unique to me or to fathers or to sons. I’m simply limited by only having experienced being those two things. I was and am a son and for the last thirteen years, I’ve been a dad to one. So those are the releationships I feel qualified to focus my experience on. Twenty seven others wanted it to exist so much they put down $100 (which we haven’t spent, promise). We aren’t just making it for ourselves and our sons anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
      I started writing all the reasons we aren’t further along with the actual thing but they felt definsive and trite. I edited them out. We’ve started building again with renewed enthusiasm for the idea. I need it out of my head and into existence. We are keeping it simple but aren’t going to hack something together in a week like we started out attempting to do. It’s a thoughtful sort of platform. It deserves a thoughtful sort of approach.
      </p>
      <p>
      That’s it. More soon.
