      <p>Another year in the books. Oliver is 12. I worked fewer hours this year, spent more of them thinking about the time I have left with him and tried to make the most of it. But as I look at this countdown (mine says 395 days), I feel a little more urgency and a little less impressed with myself. How I chose to spend my time this year isn’t how I plan to spend my time in 2016.</p>
      <p>We floated the idea of making Future Father in October of 2014. Around 500 people signed up. A few were offended that the idea is for dads and sons. Gender is culturally complex right now. Likely it always was and I didn’t notice. What I noticed was a problem I have with my dad and one he has with his dad and one I don’t want my sons to have with me. I am working on this for selfish reasons to solve personal problems but I know they are not unique to me. 27 others wanted it to exist so much they put down $100 (which we haven’t spent, promise). So we aren’t just making it for ourselves or our sons anymore.</p>
      <p>I started writing all the reasons we aren’t further along with the thing but they aren’t very exciting. We are starting the new year with renewed excitement for the idea. It needs to exist. We are keeping it simple but aren’t just going to hack something together in a week like we started out intending to do. It’s a thoughtful sort of product and deserves a thoughtful sort of approach.</p>
      <p>Hope you gave yourself a break for the holiday and made some memories. See you more in 2016.</p>
