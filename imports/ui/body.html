      <p>
      Over the years, designing and developing things for the web, I convinced myself that the insane hours I was working were for my wife and kids. The thinking went that if I just committed extra time to learning, making and reading the right articles, one day I’d reach a level of productivity and prestige which would afford me the time and money I needed, to make the dream life with my family. What should’ve been obvious wasn’t. Research from a 75 year study on happiness shows how wrong I was. Quality relationships make us happy and healthy <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness" target="_blank">(video)</a>. Those are the two things I want for my son and myself and for you.
      </p>
      <p>
      We floated the idea of making Future Father in October of 2014. Around 500 people signed up. A few were offended that the idea is for dads and sons. The decision to focus on that one relationship until we get it right wasn’t made lightly. Gender is culturally complex. Even more so now than when we started. Likely, it always was and I didn’t notice. What I noticed, was a problem I have with my dad and one he has with his dad and one I don’t want my sons to have with me. I am working on this for selfish reasons to solve personal problems but I know they aren’t unique to me. Twenty seven others wanted it to exist so much they put down $100 (which we haven’t spent, promise). So we aren’t just making it for ourselves and our sons anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
      I started writing all the reasons we aren’t further along with the thing but they aren’t very exciting. We are starting again with renewed excitement for the idea. I need it to exist. We are keeping it simple but aren’t just going to hack something together in a week like we started out intending to do. It’s a thoughtful sort of product and deserves a thoughtful sort of approach. Thanks
      </p>
      <p>
      More soon.
