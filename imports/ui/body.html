      Not sure when it started exactly, but at some point in the last fifteen years, while making things for the web, I convinced myself that the insane hours I was working were for my wife and kids. You know, for our collective “future.” I was sure if I just devoted extra time to learning, making, reading and collaborating with the right smart people, eventually I’d reach a level of success which would afford me the time and money needed to live the life I dreamed of living with my family. What’s obvious now, wasn’t always. Research from a 75 year study on the happiness of Harvard graduates shows how wrong I was <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness" target="_blank">(video)</a>. I didn’t go to college but I’m comfortable assuming that what the study found, applies to me anyway. It concluded that above all else, quality relationships are what make us happy and healthy. More than anything, happiness and health are what I want for my son. I hope them for you and <span class="his-name">your son</span> as well.

      When we floated the idea of making Future Father back in October of 2014, around 500 people signed up. The idea was spurred by a problem I have with my dad. It’s the same problem he has with his dad. The problem is, we don’t go out of our way to make time for each other. We don’t have any “Some Day” plans for adventures. We get along great! When I need him he is there for me. I love him and he loves me. But we aren’t making the most of our short time together on Earth. This is not a problem I’m willing to have with my son or for him to have with his. I am working on Future Father for selfish reasons. I am trying to solve personal problems. But I know they aren’t unique to me or to fathers or to sons. I’m simply limited by experience. I was and am a son and for the last thirteen years, I’ve been a dad to one. So that’s the releationship I feel qualified to focus my experience on first. Twenty seven others wanted FF to exist so much they put down $100 (which, in case you’re one of them, we haven’t spent yet). We aren’t just making it for ourselves and our sons anymore. We’re materially supported by some of the world’s most prominent designers, developers and founders. We are making it for them now and for the sons they work to make proud. We’re also making it for the ambitious new dad who thinks, “If I work extra hard now, when my son is young, I’ll be able to spend real, quality time with him once I achieve success.”
      </p>
      <p>
      I started writing all the reasons we aren’t further along with the platform but they were weak excuses so I edited them out. We’ve started building again with renewed enthusiasm for the idea. I need it out of my head and into existence. We are keeping it simple but aren’t going to hack it together in a week like we started out attempting to do. It’s a thoughtful sort of platform. It deserves a thoughtful sort of approach.
      </p>
      <p>
      Happy Father’s Day. More soon.
