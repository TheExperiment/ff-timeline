      <p>
      Some time in the last fifteen years while making things for the web, I convinced myself that the insane hours I was working were for my wife and kids. For our future. I was sure if I just committed extra time to learning, making and reading the right articles, one day I’d reach a level of productivity and prestige which would afford me the time and money I needed, to live a dream life with my family. What should’ve been obvious, wasn’t. Research from a 75 year study on the happiness of Harvard men shows how wrong I was. I didn’t go to college but I’m comfortable assuming that what the study found applies to me still: Quality relationships are what make us happy and healthy <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness" target="_blank">(video)</a>. More than anything, happiness and health are what I want for my son. I hope them for you and <span class="his-name">your son</span> as well.
      </p>
      <p>
      We floated the idea of making Future Father in October of 2014. Around 500 people signed up. It was spurred by a problem I have with my dad. It’s the same one he has with his dad. We don’t go out of our way to make time for each other. We don’t make plans to have adventures. We get along great but we aren’t making the most of the short time we have left together. This is not a problem I’m willing to have with my son. I am working on Future Father for selfish reasons; trying to solve personal problems. But I know they aren’t unique to me. Twenty seven other dads wanted it to exist so much they put down $100 (which we haven’t spent, promise). So we aren’t just making it for ourselves and our sons anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
      I started writing all the reasons we aren’t further along with the actual thing but they felt definsive and trite. So we are starting again with renewed enthusiasm for the idea. I need it to exist. We are keeping it simple but aren’t just going to hack something together in a week like we started out intending to do. It’s a thoughtful sort of product and deserves a thoughtful sort of approach.

      More soon.
